HOLY FUCKSOCKS, BATMAN!!! WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS?? This is the file that gets compiled to make up your style.css file.
You should edit this files located in /library/scss. The files are broken up based on where they're used and their relevance.
Clear as mud? Sorry brochachos y brochachas. Let me try again...

Style.scss imports _bootstrap.scss. Bootstrap.scss is the file that imports all other files. Bootstrap.scss is then imported and then compiled in
style.scss. Why are we doing it like that? Because I read some shit on Medium.com and it seemed 'legit' at the time, yo.
To get some insight into our direction, read this: https://medium.com/p/7fe19ab647fa â€” by no means is that the holy
grail, but it was a starting point
